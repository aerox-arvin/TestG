- Git is a version control tool
- Install GIt locally
- Create Account in Github
- Create Repo in Github

===========
Use this link for Git commands: https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html
===========
- From your local machine - Go to cmd

- tell your user name to the Git 

*****git config --global user.name "Sam Smith"

- tell your email id

*****git config --global user.email "sam@example.com"

- Then create local repository. So, create one folder.

  Eg: I create folder in c:/GitTest

  Then run the cmd in that directory; 

*****git init

- Add our files to stash(stagging):

*****git add *

- Commit 

*****git commit -m "message"

-m is the message

- Now Push the files to github 

 First connect with the remote repository.

 ****git remote add origin https://github.com/aerox-arvin/MyLearnings.git

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

  Note: origin- remote repository.

****git push origin master

  Note: master- by default the repository is created in master branch. so it is mentioned.


Then, it will ask for credentials. Once credentials are verified commit will happen.

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Git clone is to pull the code from Github repository for the first time.

****git clone https://github.com/aerox-arvin/MyLearnings.git

Here, we have to give the repository origin details.

- How to Clone a Specific Branch
Now let's clone a specific branch from our demo repository. There are two ways to clone a specific branch. You can either:

Clone the repository, fetch all branches, and checkout to a specific branch immediately.
Clone the repository and fetch only a single branch.


****git clone --branch <branchname> <remote-repo-url>
or

****git clone -b <branchname> <remote-repo-url>

- Git pull is used to update the local repository with recent changes commited in GitHub repository.

****git pull origin master

Note: git status : will list the modified files in stagging

Create new branch from master branch:

****git checkout -b {new branch name}

TO know the current branch 

****git branch

How to switch to a other branch

****git checkout {branch name}

How to merge:

Eg: If I want to merge latest code in "testbranch" into "master"

     I have to switch to master 
     pull the code from master
     then run the below command with "testbranch"
      ****git merge {branchname}
     Then stash-->commit--->Push

================
stash (stagging) ---- Is commit 1 --- Initially files are commited to stash

commit ---- Is commit 2 --- Files in stash alone get commited
